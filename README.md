## TO_DO's

Title Screen waiting for user input to start playback and a place for playback to return to when done instead of looping all 16 tracks indefinitely. Will have to fit on to whatever bank along with its custom visual code.

Breakout default init and update behavior code.

Abstract individual bank runtimes:
- booter shouldn't include init_track
- init_track shouldn't include titlet plotting
- nmi should call custom render/update first
